# AlertGuard-Helmet
It's a final year btech project. The helmet helps in object collosion detection through ultrasonic sensors and warns the driver through audio and it also detects the traffic signs and signals through cameras attached to helmet using image processing and also warns the driver. The automatic brake triggering mechanism at the time of object collision detection reduces the speed of vehicle to avoid collision.
